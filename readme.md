# Physics simulations using the pygame library in Python

## Bouncing ball simulation
This simulation uses the physics concept of coefficient of restitution to simulate a ball bouncing up and down off a horizontal surface. 
It makes use of simple algebra, and kinematics concepts. 

## Pendulum simulation
Takes length of the string, and initial angle of displacement as inputs, and simulates an oscillating pendulum. 
It makes use of basic algebra, trigonometry and kinematics. Also calculates the time period of the pendulum.
